## Docker Image

To run the Parity exporter on Docker, you can use the [honeylogic/parity_exporter](https://hub.docker.com/r/honeylogic/parity_exporter)
image. It exposes port 9997 and expects the config in `/app/config.yml`. To
configure it, you can bind-mount a config from your host:

```
$ docker run -p 9997:9997 -v /path/on/host/config.yml:/app/config.yml honeylogic/parity_exporter
```

Specify the config as the CMD:

```
$ docker run -p 9997:9997 -v /path/on/host/config.yml:/config/config.yml honeylogic/parity_exporter --config /config/config.yml
```

Or create a config file named /app/config.yml along with following
Dockerfile in the same directory and build it with `docker build`:

```
FROM honeylogic/parity_exporter
```
